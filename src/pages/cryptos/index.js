                                    Technically, the cryptocurrency market is an innovative space that is believed to play a critical role in the future financial market in several countries. Even though the rewards can be enormous, the risks involved are considered to outweigh the returns. With that being said, since subscriptions are mostly used to access digital products rather than for investment purposes, the rewards and risks involved in buying the subscriptions of an early-stage startup company are usually moderate.

                                    The introduction of a cryptocurrency i.e. bitcoin is an amazing mechanism for the global economy, but there's no single use case for the asset other than for investment purposes, which makes bitcoin and every single cryptocurrency to be radically volatile. Not only that subscriptions can be bought, sold, and transferred, but they can also be used to access problem-solving products.
