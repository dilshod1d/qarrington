                                        When you open a Qarrington account, a secretKey will automatically be generated for the account. Although you can always change your accessKey, once your secretKey is generated, you will not be able to change it later. For this reason, you're required to copy your secretKey somewhere safe. It's called a secretKey because it's the sole of your account and it must not be shared with anyone.
